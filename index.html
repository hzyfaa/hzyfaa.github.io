        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>Throughout my academic experience in the Computer Science program, I have acquired essential knowledge and
            practical experience that have significantly enhanced my technical skills, problem-solving capabilities, and
            professional values. I have engaged in various projects and coursework that have refined my abilities and
            equipped me for a successful career in the field of computer science.</p>

        <h3>Growth</h3>
        <p>From the initial stages of the program, I aimed to expand on my technical expertise and apply theoretical
            knowledge to real-world scenarios. Some of my most important takeaways have been the ability to design,
            develop,
            and optimize software solutions that align with industry best practices.</p>
        <p>I have gained hands-on experience in full-stack web development, data structures and algorithms, database
            management, and cybersecurity. The coursework has reinforced these concepts and allowed me to incorporate
            them
            into a portfolio that showcases my capabilities. Developing my ePortfolio has been a crucial component in
            demonstrating my strengths and establishing my professional goals.</p>
        <p>With continuous enhancements to my artifacts, I have significantly improved my ability to assess design
            trade-offs,
            implement innovative solutions, and justify my technical decisions.</p>

        <h2>Core Competencies and Key Skills</h2>

        <h3>Collaborating in a Team Environment</h3>
        <p>I have developed a solid understanding of how software development is structured in an industrial setting.
            Through various projects involving real-world scenarios and research, I have learned about several key
            aspects
            of collaboration in a team environment, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Agile and Scrum methodologies, which emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability.
            </li>
            <li>Various stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), including requirements gathering, design,
                implementation, testing, and deployment.</li>
            <li>Version control systems like Git, which facilitate collaborative coding and efficient project
                management.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Communicating with Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>In addition to technical skills, communicating with stakeholders is crucial in the field of computer science.
            Throughout the program, I have practiced this skill by developing technical documentation and presentations
            that describe software solutions and justify design choices. This has strengthened my ability to communicate
            effectively with both technical and non-technical audiences, ensuring that my proposed solutions align with
            business objectives.</p>

        <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
        <p>Data structures and algorithms are fundamental to building large-scale and efficient applications. I have
            worked
            with various data structures such as hash tables, trees, and linked lists, and I have experience selecting
            appropriate structures for specific problems.</p>
        <p>For example, I have implemented sorting algorithms like Merge Sort to optimize data preprocessing and used
            graph
            algorithms for tasks such as network routing. Additionally, I have applied search optimization techniques
            like
            binary search for faster data retrieval and used trie data structures for search engines. These experiences
            have strengthened my ability to analyze and apply algorithmic solutions that enhance application efficiency
            and scalability.</p>

        <h3>Software Engineering and Databases</h3>
        <p>Software engineering principles have guided me in designing and developing scalable, maintainable
            applications.
            Throughout the program, I have applied concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), design patterns,
            and software architecture best practices.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I have worked extensively with relational databases such as SQL, designing efficient schemas,
            normalizing data, and optimizing queries. I have also explored NoSQL databases for handling unstructured
            data.
            With my understanding of indexing techniques and query optimization strategies, I have successfully built
            efficient and scalable data-driven applications.</p>

        <h3>Security Awareness and Best Practices</h3>
        <p>Security is a fundamental aspect of software development. I have incorporated best practices into my projects
            to
            protect against vulnerabilities. I have experience with both static and dynamic security testing, as well as
            secure coding techniques such as encryption, secure authentication and authorization, and secure data
            storage.</p>
