                The artifact that I chose is a full-stack web application that I developed as part of my coursework for
                CS 465: Full-Stack Development in my previous term. The application is a travel web application
                developed using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) stack framework. The features include
                a customer-facing website where users could view a list of different travel packages and an admin portal
                for managing these travel packages. Additionally, the admin page includes a login portal to authorize
                users before they can edit or add travel packages.

                    Clients can only view preloaded trips. To make the app more practical, I implemented an external API
                    that could be used to retrieve travel data such as flights, hotels, etc. Additionally, some UI
                    features
                    were improved for a more modern and engaging look. The user should be able to search for locations
                    using a search functionality. Finally, I implemented routes and pages for user authentication.

                    working on cleaning these areas up. The most challenging part was finding an appropriate API for

                    I implemented an optimized search algorithm to handle large data sets of airports effectively.
                    Additionally, I implemented a cache for search results to further improve speed and responsiveness.
                    Specifically, I implemented a debounce search with a progressive search filter. Every time a
                    character is typed (after 3 minimum), the user is presented with a dropdown list of suggestions that
                    are most
                    likely to be chosen. I used a trie structure to implement this function. The search operation
                    involves
                    traversal of characters based on the input query, one character at a time. The time complexity is
                    O(M)O(K) on
                    average, where K is the number of results found.

                    Setting up a search mechanism was quite challenging. I managed to set up a Trie data structure for

                    search but mostly had difficulty implementing progressive filtering for my search engine. I also set

                    other optimization techniques like cache results to further improve performance.
