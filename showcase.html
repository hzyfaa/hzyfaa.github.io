            <h2>Artifact Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The artifact that I chose is a full-stack web application that I developed as part of my coursework for
                CS 465: Full-Stack Development in my previous term. The application is a travel web application
                developed using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) stack framework. The features include
                a customer-facing website where users could view a list of different travel packages and an admin portal
                for managing these travel packages. Additionally, the admin page includes a login portal to authorize
                users before they can edit or add travel packages.

        <div class="narrative">
            <p>Clients can only view preloaded trips. To make the app more practical, I implemented an external API that
                could be used to retrieve travel data such as flights, hotels, etc. Additionally, some UI features were
                improved for a more modern and engaging look. Finally, the user should be able to search for locations
                using a
                search functionality.
            </p>

            <h3>Outcomes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are
                    coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and
                    designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced
                    security of data and resources.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in
                    computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and
                    accomplish industry-specific goals.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="reflection">
                I found a lot of code from the original work that was either not required or redundant and have been
                working on cleaning these areas up. The most challenging part was finding an appropriate API for what
                I'm trying to achieve.
